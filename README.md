# Hello!, iOS/iWatch Developers :wave:
Welcome! 
Practicing interview questions regularly is crucial, as it completes our preparation for life. Interview practice holds significant importance in our journey.

Numerous iOS developers have expressed the desire for a compilation of interview questions to aid in their interview preparations. It's important to note that this list will always remain ongoing and evolving.

To ensure you have access to valuable interview questions whenever you need them, I've established this open-source repository.
